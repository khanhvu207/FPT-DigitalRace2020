**Tools: C++, ROS, OpenCV, Pytorch.**

The platform that I used for this personal project is from FPT DigitalRace contest 2019, 2020. 
This project has 2 stages:
  1. Create a simple and efficient algorithm which built solely on OpenCV library to detect objects and steer the vehicle (finished - Nov 2019)
  2. Manipulate and develop a deep neural network model to fully control the vehicle (in progress).
